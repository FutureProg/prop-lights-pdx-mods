	<LongDescription>
In vanilla, When lights are plopped directly by the player,
they are on during both the day and the night. This mod fixes that by introducing time-synced lighting for light props plopped by players.
Illuminate your cityscape with lights that dynamically adjust to the time of day, creating a realistic and immersive urban environment.
Watch as the streets come alive with the glow of dawn, the vibrant hues of sunset, and the twinkling lights of nightfall.
Whether it's the bustling downtown or serene suburbs, every corner of your city will radiate with life, adding depth and realism to your urban masterpiece.
